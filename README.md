# Course Scheduler

This is a project that I made for my Data Structures and Algorithms class. 
 
The program that I have written was designed to read a text file and then take the data from the file to store the contents into a vector. The vector was then selection sorted. Through the main menu, the user could search for a particular course within the catalog, and it will return the course name and pre-requisite courses required to take that course. 

I approached this project by first deciding what data structure would be best to store the contents of my text file, in a sensible manner. I eventually decided to use a vector since it would be easy to implement and easy to sort. It also proved to be pretty fast at searching through the data and overall is a better choice than binary search trees and hash tables. I reviewed any of my personal coursework relating to selection sorting while completing the project because that was still a little confusing for me. 

Through this project, I have learned a lot about data structures and particularly vectors. I also learned a lot about sorting vectors and returning specified data to the user. This project has enacouraged me to amke more sensible pseudocode so that my coding is easy and structured. I spent hours on my pseudocode and only about an hour on the actual coding, so I think proper preparation work is required to build successful programs.
